I'm a fourth-year software engineering student at the University of Victoria, with a keen interest in performance and scalability, distributed systems design, and AI/ML. I have practical experience developing applications using Java, Python, C++, Node.js, Kubernetes, and Docker. I'm particularly interested in AI/ML and have developed models for sentiment analysis and image recognition.

I'm a detail-oriented and collaborative software engineer with a passion for innovation. My experience includes developing a real-time chat application using Node.js and designing a distributed system for a music streaming platform. I'm eager to join a software engineering team that shares my dedication to excellence and constantly seeks new challenges.
